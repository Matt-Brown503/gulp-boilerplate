My basic Gulp boilerplate.

Unable to find a gulp tutorial/repo that had included SASS
I made this for myself so I could start projects faster.
You may find it rough around the edges and there is room for improvement.

It based off various tutorials I found online for adding theses tools to gulp.

Includes:
• Bootstrap 3
• SASS (scss)
• Auto-prefixer
• Uglify
